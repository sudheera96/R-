What is two to the power of five?
In [1]:
x<-2^5
x 
Out[1]:
32

Create a vector called stock.prices with the following data points: 23,27,23,21,34
In [4]:
stock.prices<-cat(c(23,27,23,21,34),sep = "\n")

Out[4]:
1.	23
2.	27
3.	23
4.	21
5.	34

Assign names to the price data points relating to the day of the week, starting with Mon, Tue, Wed, etc...
In [6]:
stock.prices<-c(23,27,23,21,34)
names(stock.prices)<-c("Mon","Tue","Wed","Thur","Fri")
names(stock.prices)
stock.prices

o/p:
> stock.prices
 Mon  Tue  Wed Thur  Fri 
  23   27   23   21   34 


What was the average (mean) stock price for the week? (You may need to reference a built-in function)
In [7]:

average<-function(mean){
  mean=mean(stock.prices)
  mean
}
  
average(mean)
Out[7]:
25.6

Create a vector called over.23 consisting of logicals that correspond to the days where the stock price was more than $23
In [8]:
stock.prices>23
o/p:
> stock.prices>23
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

Use the over.23 vector to filter out the stock.prices vector and only return the day and prices where the price was over $23
In [9]:
> which(stock.prices>23)
[1] 2 5
Out[9]:
Tues 27 Fri 34

Use a built-in function to find the day the price was the highest
In [16]:
max(stock.prices)
Out[16]:
Fri: 34
